# Backlink Conventions in DSS

## Overview

Backlinks are references that connect files that reference each other, making navigation and dependency tracking easier across the project. This document outlines conventions for implementing and maintaining backlinks in the DSS framework.

## Purpose of Backlinks

Backlinks serve several important functions:

1. **Discoverability**: Make it easy to find all files that reference a particular document
2. **Dependency Tracking**: Clarify which files depend on or reference other files
3. **Impact Analysis**: Help assess the impact of changes to a file by seeing what depends on it
4. **Navigation**: Provide bidirectional navigation between related files

## Backlink Implementation

DSS implements backlinks in two complementary ways:

### 1. YAML Frontmatter References

The primary method uses the existing `provides` and `requires` metadata fields:

```yaml
---
tags: [guide, documentation]
provides: [backlink_implementation, reference_tracking]
requires: [meta/dss_config.yml, docs/automated_formatting]
---
```

This approach establishes formal dependencies but lacks specific context about where and how the reference is used.

### 2. Explicit Backlinks Section

To provide more context, each file should include a "Referenced By" section at the end of the document:

```markdown
## Referenced By

- [meta/scripts/sync_dss_mdc.py](mdc:meta/scripts/sync_dss_mdc.py) - Used as source file for Cursor rule generation
- [INDEX.md](mdc:INDEX.md) - Listed in file tree overview
- [docs/automated_formatting](mdc:docs/automated_formatting) - Referenced in automation documentation
```

For code files, this section should be included in the file's docstring or as a comment block at the end.

## Backlink Maintenance Guidelines

### For the Assistant

1. **Update During Renaming**: When renaming a file, update all backlinks that reference it
2. **Add When Creating References**: When adding a reference to a file, also add a backlink in the referenced file
3. **Verify Bidirectionality**: Ensure that if file A references file B, file B includes a backlink to file A
4. **Include Context**: Add a brief description of how the file is used or referenced
5. **Format Consistently**: Use the Markdown link format `[filename](mdc:path/to/file)` for all backlinks

### For Automation Scripts

1. **Backlink Scanner**: Implement a tool that scans for references and updates backlinks
2. **Pre-Commit Hook**: Add a pre-commit check that verifies backlink consistency
3. **Documentation Generator**: Extend the documentation generator to include backlink sections

## Implementation in `convert_to_dss.py`

Add backlink detection and generation to the conversion process:

```python
def generate_backlinks(files_map):
    """
    Generate a mapping of files to their backlinks by analyzing file contents.
    
    Args:
        files_map: Dict mapping file paths to their content
        
    Returns:
        Dict mapping file paths to lists of files that reference them
    """
    backlinks = defaultdict(list)
    
    # Pattern to match file references in Markdown and code
    md_pattern = r'\[([^\]]+)\]\((mdc:)?([^)]+)\)'
    code_pattern = r'(import|from|require)[^\n]*([\'\"])([^\'\"]+)([\'\"])'
    
    for source_file, content in files_map.items():
        # Extract Markdown links
        for match in re.finditer(md_pattern, content, re.MULTILINE):
            target_file = match.group(3)
            if target_file in files_map:
                backlinks[target_file].append((source_file, "Markdown reference"))
                
        # Extract code imports/requires
        for match in re.finditer(code_pattern, content, re.MULTILINE):
            target_file = match.group(3)
            if target_file in files_map:
                backlinks[target_file].append((source_file, "Code import/require"))
                
        # Extract YAML frontmatter requires
        if 'requires:' in content:
            yaml_block = extract_yaml_frontmatter(content)
            if yaml_block and 'requires' in yaml_block:
                for req in yaml_block['requires']:
                    backlinks[req].append((source_file, "Required in frontmatter"))
    
    return backlinks

def add_backlinks_section(file_path, content, backlinks):
    """Add or update a backlinks section in a file."""
    if not backlinks:
        return content
        
    backlinks_header = "## Referenced By\n\n"
    backlinks_content = "\n".join([
        f"- [{source}](mdc:{source}) - {context}" 
        for source, context in backlinks
    ])
    
    # Check if file already has a backlinks section
    if "## Referenced By" in content:
        # Replace existing section
        pattern = r"## Referenced By\n\n(.*?)(\n##|\Z)"
        replacement = f"## Referenced By\n\n{backlinks_content}\n\n"
        content = re.sub(pattern, replacement, content, flags=re.DOTALL)
    else:
        # Add new section at the end
        content += f"\n\n{backlinks_header}{backlinks_content}\n"
        
    return content
```

## Best Practices

1. **Prioritize Important References**: Not every casual mention needs a backlink; focus on substantive dependencies
2. **Group Related Backlinks**: When a file has many backlinks, group them by category or purpose
3. **Update Backlinks Proactively**: Add backlinks immediately when creating new references
4. **Verify During Code Review**: Check for backlink consistency during code review
5. **Consider Automation**: Implement automated backlink generation where possible

## Integration with DSS Workflows

Backlink maintenance should be integrated into the following workflows:

1. **File Creation**: Add backlink placeholders when creating new files
2. **Documentation Updates**: Verify and update backlinks when updating documentation
3. **Refactoring**: Ensure backlinks are updated when moving or renaming files
4. **Code Review**: Include backlink verification in code review checklists

## Example Backlinks Implementation

### In a Documentation File

```markdown
# Data Processing Module

This document describes the data processing pipeline...

[Content of the document...]

## Referenced By

- [src/pipeline_runner.py](mdc:src/pipeline_runner.py) - Imports the processing functions
- [docs/architecture.md](mdc:docs/architecture.md) - References in system architecture diagram
- [meta/TODO.md](mdc:meta/TODO.md) - Listed as dependency for Task #42
```

### In a Code File

```python
"""---
tags: [code, core_functionality]
provides: [data_processing_functions, transformation_pipeline]
requires: [src/utils/data_helpers.py, src/config/processing_config.py]
---

Data processing module containing core transformation functions.

[Module description and code...]

# Referenced By
# - src/main.py - Imported for main data processing pipeline
# - tests/test_processing.py - Tested in unit tests
# - docs/data_processing.md - Documented in detail
"""
```

## Conclusion

Consistent implementation of backlinks significantly enhances the navigability and maintainability of a DSS project. By following these conventions, you ensure that dependencies between files are clearly documented and easily discoverable, reducing the cognitive load of understanding and modifying the codebase.
