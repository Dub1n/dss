# DSS Project Roadmap - Detailed

See the high-level roadmap overview at [../ROADMAP.md](../ROADMAP.md).

This document outlines the key next steps and planned features for the DSS (Data SuperStructure) project, organized by topic.

## Meta Scripts & Core Logic

- [ ] **Unit tests**: Add comprehensive pytest coverage for the `convert_to_dss.py` and `llm_tasks.py` scripts to ensure reliability.
- [ ] **Incremental diffing**: Modify `llm_tasks.py` to identify and process only changed files or directories, significantly improving efficiency.
- [ ] **Rich progress UI**: Integrate the `rich` library into scripts like `convert_to_dss.py` to provide better visual feedback with spinners and progress bars.
- [ ] Make sure all the scripts work (especially sync_dss_mdc.py)
- [ ] Work out when each of the scripts should be run, manually or scheduled/triggered, and how that can be implemeneted. Should assistant.mdc include running the scripts as part of the LLM's routines/routine checks?

## Tooling & Developer Experience

- [ ] **Sub-command CLIs**: Develop an entry-point `dss` console tool to wrap and manage the various meta scripts as sub-commands (e.g., `dss convert`, `dss docs`).

## Project Infrastructure

- [ ] **CI badge & docs site**: Set up continuous integration status badges and publish a documentation website (e.g., using MkDocs) based on the content in the `/docs/` directory.

## Release Management

- [ ] **Template repo release**: Prepare the repository for its initial public release as a GitHub template, tagging it as `v1.0`.

## Source Code (`/src/`)

- [ ] Develop core functionality within `/src/`

## Data Files (`/data/`)

- [ ] Establish data processing pipelines in `/data/`

## Documentation (`/docs/`)

- [ ] Write comprehensive documentation for `/docs/` components
- [ ] Refine AI interaction design principles and implementation
- [ ] Go over all of this repo's files and make sure they are actually usefully laid out and have the appropriate information (includes file description stubs, frontmatter, backlinks, etc.)
- [ ] Create an INDEX.md template file
- [ ] Think if there are any other template files that could be useful and make those in the template folder (a Suggested User Rules one would be handy)

## Canvas Diagrams (`/canvas/`)

- [ ] Replace placeholder canvas with generated layout

## Other / Cross-Cutting

- [ ] Integrate new OAuth flow
- [ ] Teach the AI to cross-reference .mdc files with commit messages to refine intent tracking.
- [ ] Set up a daily summary ping (here's what changed today, here's what I learned, here's what we should clarify next).

## DSS Repo Development Timeline

Strategic optimizations to enhance the DSS framework's core goals, organized in a timeline to maximize development efficiency with AI assistance.

### Phase 1: Foundation & Immediate Wins (1-2 Months)
*Focus: Templates, basic automation, and core functionality that AI can help implement quickly*

- [ ] **Create an INDEX.md template file**: Design a standardized template for automatic generation (AI can draft the template)
- [ ] **LLM-optimized naming conventions**: Establish file/folder naming patterns for semantic discoverability (AI can analyze and propose conventions)
- [ ] **Dynamic INDEX.md generation**: Script to auto-regenerate INDEX.md from current structure and frontmatter (AI can help with algorithm design)
- [ ] **Front-matter validation & auto-correction**: Build validation for proper DSS frontmatter (AI can implement validation logic)
- [ ] **Template customization framework**: Create adaptable templates for different project types (AI can generate specialized templates)
- [ ] **Integration testing suite**: Basic tests for core scripts (AI can write test cases based on expected behavior)

### Phase 2: Self-Healing Capabilities (2-4 Months)
*Focus: Making the repository actively maintain itself*

- [ ] **Automated link validation & repair**: Script to detect and fix broken internal links (AI can implement the detection logic)
- [ ] **Smart file movement detection**: Update links/dependencies when files are moved (AI can help trace references)
- [ ] **Dependency graph visualization**: Generate visual maps from metadata (AI can design the visualization format)
- [ ] **DSS health dashboard**: Command for at-a-glance repo compliance view (AI can implement the reporting logic)
- [ ] **Context optimization analysis**: Measure token efficiency of DSS structure (AI can analyze patterns and make recommendations)
- [ ] **Smart summarization triggers**: Auto-detect when folders need README updates (AI can implement the detection heuristics)

### Phase 3: Advanced Automation & Integration (4-6 Months)
*Focus: Deeper system integration and workflow automation*

- [ ] **Git hook integration**: Automatic DSS maintenance triggered by commits (AI can design the hook scripts)
- [ ] **CI/CD pipeline templates**: GitHub Actions workflows for DSS validation (AI can generate workflow YAML files)
- [ ] **Archive hygiene automation**: Auto-detect content for archiving (AI can implement detection rules)
- [ ] **Contextual prompt injection**: Dynamic .cursor/rules/ content based on context (AI can design the context-switching logic)
- [ ] **Performance optimization**: Optimize scripts for large repositories (AI can profile and suggest improvements)
- [ ] **Migration quality metrics**: Score repository DSS compliance (AI can implement scoring algorithms)

### Phase 4: Meta-Learning & Evolution (6+ Months)
*Focus: Self-improvement and advanced capabilities*

- [ ] **Usage pattern analysis**: Analytics on how DSS repositories are used (AI can design metrics and visualization)
- [ ] **LLM feedback loops**: Mechanisms for LLMs to suggest DSS improvements (AI can implement its own feedback mechanism)
- [ ] **Best practice extraction**: Document emerging patterns from successful implementations (AI can identify and extract patterns)
- [ ] **Self-documentation**: Auto-document repository evolution and rationale (AI can implement the documentation generation)
- [ ] **Content freshness monitoring**: Track potentially outdated documentation (AI can implement the detection heuristics)
- [ ] **Cross-repository learning**: Share patterns across DSS implementations (AI can design the pattern-sharing mechanisms)
- [ ] **Semantic file clustering**: Use embeddings to identify logical file groupings (AI can implement the clustering algorithm)
- [ ] **Multi-format export**: Generate docs in multiple formats (AI can implement the conversion logic)

## Completed

- [x] Bootstrap DSS template (2025‑05‑24)
