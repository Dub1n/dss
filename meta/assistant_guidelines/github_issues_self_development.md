# Assistant Guidelines: GitHub Issues Self-Development Integration

This document provides specific guidance for the AI assistant on how to leverage GitHub Issues as a primary driver for DSS self-improvement and development prioritization.

## Overview

The GitHub Issues Integration system creates a continuous feedback loop where community-reported problems automatically become structured development tasks. The assistant plays a crucial role in:
1. **Triggering automated analysis** at appropriate times
2. **Interpreting patterns** and suggesting improvements
3. **Prioritizing development work** based on user impact
4. **Tracking progress** and closing feedback loops

## When to Trigger Issue Analysis

### Automatic Triggers

The assistant should proactively suggest issue analysis in these scenarios:

#### 1. Weekly Development Review
- **Trigger**: Every 7 days since last analysis, or when user asks about "what to work on"
- **Action**: Suggest running full GitHub Issues analysis
- **Script**: `python meta/scripts/github_issues_processor.py --generate-tasks`

#### 2. Installation Report Context
- **Trigger**: User mentions installation problems or bootstrap failures
- **Action**: Focus analysis on installation reports
- **Script**: `python meta/scripts/github_issues_processor.py --analyze-reports --generate-tasks`

#### 3. Platform-Specific Issues
- **Trigger**: User reports platform-specific problems
- **Action**: Analyze platform-specific issue patterns
- **Script**: `python meta/scripts/github_issues_processor.py --labels platform-windows platform-linux platform-darwin --generate-tasks`

#### 4. Component-Specific Work
- **Trigger**: Working on specific DSS components (bootstrap, cursor, documentation)
- **Action**: Analyze issues related to that component
- **Script**: `python meta/scripts/github_issues_processor.py --labels bootstrap cursor-integration documentation --generate-tasks`

### User-Requested Analysis

#### Direct Requests
Respond to these user requests by triggering appropriate analysis:

- **"What should I work on next?"** → Full development queue analysis
- **"Are there any bugs to fix?"** → Focus on `bug` labeled issues
- **"What improvements are users asking for?"** → Focus on `enhancement` labeled issues
- **"How can I improve DSS?"** → Comprehensive pattern analysis

#### Example Response Template

```markdown
I'll analyze recent GitHub Issues to identify the highest-impact improvements for DSS.

Let me run the issue analysis script to detect patterns and generate prioritized development tasks:

[Run script with appropriate parameters]

Based on the analysis, I'll review:
1. **Pattern Detection**: Common issues across multiple reports
2. **Priority Calculation**: Impact × Frequency × Platform Reach
3. **Task Generation**: Specific, actionable development items
4. **Success Metrics**: How to measure improvement

This will help us focus on changes that will help the most users succeed with DSS.
```

## Issue Analysis Interpretation

### Pattern Recognition

When reviewing analysis results, help users understand:

#### 1. Installation Pattern Significance
```markdown
## Installation Pattern Analysis

**Pattern**: "Bootstrap timeout on Windows" (5 occurrences)
**Significance**: This affects 23% of Windows installations based on recent reports
**Impact**: High - prevents successful DSS adoption
**Recommendation**: High priority task - improve timeout handling and provide better progress feedback
```

#### 2. Platform Distribution Insights
```markdown
## Platform Impact Assessment

**Windows Issues**: 12 reports (40% of total)
**Linux Issues**: 8 reports (27% of total)  
**macOS Issues**: 5 reports (17% of total)
**Cross-platform**: 5 reports (17% of total)

**Insight**: Windows users experience disproportionate issues - focus platform-specific improvements there first.
```

#### 3. Component Health Analysis
```markdown
## Component Reliability Analysis

**Bootstrap Script**: 15 issues (65% of total) - needs stability improvements
**Cursor Integration**: 5 issues (22% of total) - generally stable
**Documentation**: 3 issues (13% of total) - minor gaps

**Recommendation**: Prioritize bootstrap reliability improvements for maximum user impact.
```

### Task Prioritization Guidance

Help users understand the prioritization logic:

#### Priority Calculation Explanation
```markdown
## Task Priority Explanation

**High Priority** (Score ≥20):
- Affects ≥10 users OR spans ≥3 platforms OR includes critical severity
- Example: Bootstrap fails on all platforms due to timeout

**Medium Priority** (Score 10-19):
- Affects 5-9 users OR spans 2 platforms OR medium severity
- Example: Project type detection issues for Android projects

**Low Priority** (Score <10):
- Affects <5 users OR single platform OR low severity
- Example: Documentation clarity improvements
```

## Development Task Management

### Task Review Process

When new tasks are generated, guide the user through review:

#### 1. Task Assessment
```markdown
I've generated [X] new development tasks from recent GitHub Issues:

**High Priority** ([X] tasks):
- [Task 1]: [Brief description] - affects [Y] users
- [Task 2]: [Brief description] - spans [Z] platforms

**Medium Priority** ([X] tasks):
- [Task 3]: [Brief description] - [impact summary]

**Low Priority** ([X] tasks):
- [List if manageable, otherwise summarize]

Would you like me to:
1. **Detail any specific task** for implementation planning?
2. **Suggest which task to start with** based on your current context?
3. **Break down a complex task** into smaller steps?
```

#### 2. Implementation Planning
When user selects a task, provide structured guidance:

```markdown

#### From Issues → Other Workflows
- **Complex Tasks** → [Task Decomposition](mdc:meta/assistant_workflows/task_decomposition.md)
- **Code Changes** → [Code Modification](mdc:meta/assistant_workflows/code_modification.md)  
- **Documentation Gaps** → [Documentation Refactoring](mdc:meta/assistant_workflows/documentation_refactoring.md)
- **New Features** → [Docs-Driven Development](mdc:meta/assistant_workflows/docs_driven_development.md)

#### Feedback Loop Integration
This process enhances the [feedback loop mechanism](mdc:meta/assistant_guidelines/feedback_loop.md):
- **Automated Collection**: GitHub Issues provide systematic feedback
- **Pattern Analysis**: Replaces manual pattern identification
- **Structured Integration**: Task generation creates actionable improvements
- **Progress Tracking**: Completion metrics show improvement impact

## Best Practices

### Analysis Frequency
- **Weekly**: Full issue analysis and task generation
- **Post-Release**: Analysis after major updates to assess impact
- **On-Demand**: When user reports recurring problems

### Communication Style
- **Be Proactive**: Suggest analysis when patterns emerge
- **Explain Impact**: Help users understand why issues matter
- **Provide Context**: Connect individual issues to broader patterns
- **Track Progress**: Maintain visible progress on improvements

### Error Handling
- **GitHub CLI Issues**: Provide fallback manual instructions
- **No Issues Found**: Suggest expanding search criteria or timeframe
- **Analysis Failures**: Offer manual pattern review process

This GitHub Issues integration creates a powerful self-improvement engine that turns community feedback into systematic enhancements, making DSS continuously better at helping users succeed with their projects.
