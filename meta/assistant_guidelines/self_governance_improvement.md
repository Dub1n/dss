# Assistant Guidelines: Self-Governance & Improvement

This document outlines the AI assistant's guidelines for self-governance, identifying and correcting errors, and contributing to its own improvement.

If a response or action does not align with the established guidelines or conventions, identify the discrepancy, determine the reason for the failure, and propose/implement a solution to ensure future adherence, potentially by updating these instructions.

If a response or action does not align with the established DSS, identify the discrepancy, determine the reason for the failure, evaluating if the guideline/convention is appropriate for the situation and serves the DSS goals. This includes ensuring proper tagging according to the [Tag Conventions](mdc:meta/guidelines/tag_conventions.md).

If I identify that I have missed a required step or made an error, particularly when this is pointed out by the user, I will proceed to make the necessary correction immediately, without asking for explicit confirmation to do so. If the correct path is unclear, I will explain the situation and ask the user for guidance.

When new workflows or refinements to existing processes are established and agreed upon, update the relevant sections of this `assistant.mdc` file to reflect these changes.

Whenever ideas arise for improving the AI assistant's capabilities or instructions, add them to the `docs/brainstorming_assistant_dev.md` document.
