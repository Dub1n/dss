# Chat Completion Detection Methods

## Overview

Technical approaches for detecting when Cursor AI chat responses are complete.

## Method 1: Internal Sound Trigger Hook

**Status**: Most Promising
**Technical Basis**: Cursor has experimental setting "Play sound when chat response is complete"

### Method 1 Implementation Approach

- Hook into existing internal completion trigger
- Leverage same signal that triggers experimental sound notification
- Likely event-based rather than polling-based
- Should be most reliable and performant

### Method 1 Investigation Required

- Identify internal event/signal name
- Determine if accessible via extension API
- Check if documented in Cursor's extension documentation

## Method 2: UI Element State Detection  

**Status**: Fallback/Hacky Approach
**Technical Basis**: Send button changes from "Stop" to "Send" icon

### Method 2 Implementation Approach

```javascript
// Pseudo-code for UI monitoring
const observeSendButton = () => {
  const sendButton = document.querySelector('[data-send-button]');
  const observer = new MutationObserver((mutations) => {
    mutations.forEach((mutation) => {
      if (mutation.type === 'attributes' || mutation.type === 'childList') {
        const currentIcon = getSendButtonIcon();
        if (currentIcon === 'send' && previousIcon === 'stop') {
          triggerChatCompletionEvent();
        }
      }
    });
  });
  
  observer.observe(sendButton, {
    attributes: true,
    childList: true,
    subtree: true
  });
};
```

### Method 2 Considerations

- More fragile than internal API approach
- Dependent on UI structure remaining stable
- May have performance implications with constant DOM watching
- Could break with Cursor UI updates

## Method 3: Response Stream Monitoring

**Status**: Alternative Approach
**Technical Basis**: Monitor for end of streaming response

### Method 3 Implementation Approach

- Monitor chat container for changes
- Detect when new text stops being added
- Use debouncing to avoid false positives
- Look for completion indicators in response stream

### Method 3 Challenges

- Distinguishing pauses from completion
- Handling different response types (code, text, mixed)
- Managing debounce timing

## Recommendation

Start with Method 1 (internal trigger hook) as it leverages existing Cursor functionality. Fall back to Method 2 (UI detection) if internal APIs aren't accessible.
