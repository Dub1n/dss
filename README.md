- A meta folder for guides and automation scripts
- Organized directories for source code, data, and technical documentation
- Scripts to maintain and auto-generate links and index files

## 🗂 Folder Structure

| Folder      | Purpose                                                                |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `meta/`     | Project roadmap, documentation tools, and utility scripts              |
| `docs/`     | Technical documentation like architecture and API references           |
| `src/`      | Placeholder for implementation or code examples                        |
| `data/`     | Placeholder for datasets or data references                            |

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://your-repo-url.git
2. Review and update the documentation files in `meta/` and `docs/`
3. Run link update and documentation generation scripts:

   ```bash
   python meta/update_links.py
   python meta/generate_docs.py
   ```

## 🛠 Recommended Tools

* `markdownlint-cli` for style checking
* `markdown-link-check` for dead link validation
* `prettier` or `remark` for formatting Markdown files

## 📝 Naming Conventions

This repository follows LLM-optimized naming conventions to enhance semantic discoverability:

* **Python files**: `snake_case.py` (e.g., `data_processing_pipeline.py`)
* **Documentation**: `descriptive_name.md` (e.g., `naming_conventions.md`)
* **Configuration**: `scope_config.yml` (e.g., `database_config.yml`)

Files are automatically renamed according to these conventions using:
* Git hooks that run after checkout and commit
* Pre-commit hooks for consistent enforcement
* The `auto_rename.py` script in `meta/scripts/`

For more details, see:
* [Naming Conventions](meta/guidelines/naming_conventions.md)
* [Filename Transformations](docs/filename_transformations.md)

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

Describe how documentation and scripts should be tested, e.g.:

```bash
# Run lint checks
npx markdownlint '**/*.md'

# Check links
npx markdown-link-check README.md
```
