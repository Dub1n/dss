# REALISTIC MARKING SCHEME: Authentication Module (HIDDEN)

> **⚠️ DO NOT SHOW THIS TO THE ASSISTANT DURING TESTING**

## Framework Overview

This rubric measures **automatic DSS behaviors** rather than instruction compliance. The task provided minimal guidance, so we evaluate  
whether DSS rules enabled professional decision-making automatically.

**Task Given:** "The Flask web application needs user authentication functionality. Users should be able to log in, log out, and the  
system should verify authentication tokens."

**Key Question:** Did DSS rules enable the assistant to make professional decisions without explicit instruction?

## Evaluation Examples

### Example: Excellent DSS Performance (Score: 92/100)

**What the assistant created automatically:**

```python
# src/auth/authentication.py
"""---
tags: [auth, security, flask, session]
provides: [login_user, logout_user, check_auth, auth_decorator]
requires: [user_model, flask_session, werkzeug_security]
---"""

from flask import session, request
from werkzeug.security import check_password_hash
from src.models.user import User

def login_user(username: str, password: str) -> bool:
    """Authenticate user credentials and create session."""
    user = User.get_by_username(username)
    if user and check_password_hash(user.password_hash, password):
        session['user_id'] = user.id
        session['username'] = user.username
        return True
    return False

# ... rest of implementation
```

```markdown
# docs/authentication.md
---
tags: [documentation, auth, api]
provides: [auth_documentation]
requires: [authentication_module, user_model]
---

# Authentication System

Integration with existing user model at [src/models/user.py](mdc:src/models/user.py).

## Usage
[Clear examples and cross-references]
```

**Scoring:**

* **Automatic DSS Behaviors:** 37/40 (excellent automatic behavior)
* **Technical Quality:** 32/35 (professional implementation)
* **Decision-Making:** 23/25 (excellent judgment)

### Example: Poor DSS Performance (Score: 28/100)

**What the assistant created:**

```python
# auth.py (in root directory)
def login(user, pass):
    # basic login function
    return True

def logout():
    pass

def check():
    return {}
```

**Scoring:**

* **Automatic DSS Behaviors:** 4/40 (no automatic behaviors)
* **Technical Quality:** 12/35 (functional but poor quality)
* **Decision-Making:** 12/25 (poor interpretation and choices)

## Key Evaluation Principles

### Evidence-Based Assessment

**Look for concrete evidence:**

* Frontmatter appears without being requested
* Files organized logically without organization instructions  
* Documentation created automatically with cross-references
* Code integrates with existing systems without integration guidance
* Professional patterns emerge without pattern instructions

### Multiple Valid Approaches

**Accept various solutions that demonstrate DSS principles:**

* `src/auth/authentication.py` vs `src/utils/auth.py` (both show organization)
* Different architectural approaches (as long as sound)
* Various documentation styles (as long as comprehensive)
* Different technical implementations (as long as appropriate)

### Process Over Outcome Focus

**Good process indicators:**

* Evidence of studying existing project structure
* Cross-references to existing files like `src/models/user.py`
* Maintenance of project integrity
* Professional development practices without instruction

## Deduction Guidelines

### Automatic Penalties (No warnings)

* **No frontmatter anywhere:** -10 points from Metadata score
* **Files in root directory:** -5 points from File Organization
* **No documentation created:** -8 points from Metadata score
* **No integration with existing user model:** -8 points from Integration score

### Bonus Considerations (up to +5 total)

* **Exceptional pattern recognition:** +2 points
* **Proactive security considerations:** +2 points  
* **Outstanding project integration:** +2 points
* **Creative but appropriate solutions:** +1 point

## Validation Notes

This rubric measures whether DSS rules enabled professional behavior automatically. High scores indicate successful rule implementation;  
low scores suggest rule gaps that need addressing.

**Key Success Indicator:** Solutions that look like they came from a senior developer who naturally knows best practices, rather than a  
junior developer following explicit instructions.
