# REALISTIC MARKING SCHEME: User Module Documentation (HIDDEN)

> **⚠️ DO NOT SHOW THIS TO THE ASSISTANT DURING TESTING**

## Framework Overview

This rubric measures **automatic DSS behaviors** rather than instruction compliance. The task provided minimal guidance, so we evaluate  
whether DSS rules enabled professional documentation practices automatically.

**Task Given:** "The User module in `src/models/user.py` needs documentation so other developers can understand how to use it."

**Key Question:** Did DSS rules enable the assistant to create comprehensive, professional documentation without explicit instruction?

## Evaluation Examples

### Example: Excellent DSS Performance (Score: 89/100)

**What the assistant created automatically:**

```markdown
# docs/models/user.md
---
tags: [documentation, user, models, api, flask]
provides: [user_model_documentation, user_api_guide]
requires: [user_model, flask_framework]
---

# User Model Documentation

The User model is the core user management component of the Flask application, handling user data storage, authentication verification, and API serialization.

## Integration Points

* **Authentication System:** Works with [authentication module](mdc:src/auth/authentication.py) for user verification
* **API Endpoints:** Provides data serialization for user-related API responses
* **Database:** Requires proper database configuration for user storage

## Usage Examples

```python
# Creating a new user
user = User("john_doe", "john@example.com", "hashed_password")

# Converting to API response format
user_data = user.to_dict()
# Returns: {"username": "john_doe", "email": "john@example.com"}

# Authentication check
if user.is_authenticated():
    user_id = user.get_id()
```

## Method Reference

### `__init__(username, email, password_hash)`

Creates a new User instance with the provided credentials...

[Comprehensive method documentation continues...]

**Scoring:**

* **Automatic DSS Behaviors:** 36/40 (excellent automatic documentation practices)
* **Technical Documentation Quality:** 31/35 (comprehensive and useful documentation)
* **Decision-Making Quality:** 22/25 (excellent judgment in scope and structure)

### Example: Poor DSS Performance (Score: 31/100)

**What the assistant created:**

```markdown
# user_docs.md (in root directory)

User model has some functions.

login_user() - logs in user
logout_user() - logs out user
```

**Scoring:**

* **Automatic DSS Behaviors:** 6/40 (no automatic documentation practices)
* **Technical Documentation Quality:** 12/35 (minimal content, poor quality)
* **Decision-Making Quality:** 13/25 (poor understanding of requirements)

## Key Evaluation Principles

### Evidence-Based Assessment

**Look for concrete evidence:**

* Documentation appears in appropriate location without placement instructions
* Professional frontmatter and metadata added automatically
* Cross-references to existing project files created naturally
* Code examples provided without being requested
* Integration context explained without integration guidance

### Multiple Valid Approaches

**Accept various solutions that demonstrate DSS principles:**

* `docs/user_model.md` vs `docs/models.md` vs `docs/api/user.md` (all show organization)
* Different documentation structures (as long as logical)
* Various example styles (as long as clear and useful)
* Different levels of technical detail (as long as appropriate)

### Process Over Outcome Focus

**Good process indicators:**

* Evidence of studying existing project structure and documentation
* Cross-references to relevant files like `src/models/user.py`
* Professional documentation patterns without instruction
* Maintenance of project documentation integrity

## Deduction Guidelines

### Automatic Penalties (No warnings)

* **No documentation file created:** -15 points from Content Comprehensiveness
* **No frontmatter anywhere:** -8 points from Metadata score
* **Documentation in root directory:** -5 points from File Organization
* **No code examples provided:** -7 points from Code Examples score
* **No cross-references to existing files:** -6 points from Maintenance Integration

### Bonus Considerations (up to +5 total)

* **Exceptional documentation organization:** +2 points
* **Outstanding code examples and explanations:** +2 points
* **Proactive integration with existing documentation:** +2 points
* **Creative but appropriate documentation features:** +1 point

## Validation Notes

This rubric measures whether DSS rules enabled professional documentation practices automatically. High scores indicate successful rule  
implementation for documentation workflows; low scores suggest documentation rule gaps.

**Key Success Indicator:** Documentation that looks like it came from a senior developer who naturally knows how to write excellent  
developer documentation, rather than someone following explicit documentation instructions.
