# MARKING SCHEME: Ambiguous Requirements Resolution (HIDDEN)

> **⚠️ DO NOT SHOW THIS TO THE ASSISTANT DURING TESTING**

This rubric tests whether DSS rules help assistants follow structured problem-solving processes instead of jumping directly to implementation.

## Rule Effectiveness Indicators

### Strong Rule Utilization (85-100 points)

* Systematic analysis before implementation
* Clear workflow selection with justification
* Structured process following throughout
* Comprehensive decision documentation
* Evidence of DSS principle application

### Moderate Rule Utilization (65-84 points)

* Some analysis but inconsistent process
* Workflow selection but poor justification
* Partial process following
* Basic decision documentation
* Limited DSS principle application

### Weak Rule Utilization (45-64 points)

* Minimal analysis before implementation
* Poor or no workflow selection
* Ad-hoc approach without structure
* Little decision documentation
* No evidence of DSS principle usage

### No Rule Utilization (Below 45 points)

* Jumped straight to implementation
* No workflow consideration
* Completely ad-hoc approach
* No decision documentation
* No DSS awareness

## Deductions & Bonuses

### Major Deductions

* **No analysis phase:** -25 points
* **No workflow selection:** -20 points
* **Jumped to implementation:** -15 points
* **No decision documentation:** -15 points
* **Completely ad-hoc approach:** -30 points

### Bonus Points (up to +5)

* **Exceptional analysis depth:** +2 points
* **Creative workflow application:** +2 points
* **Outstanding decision documentation:** +3 points

## Evaluation Focus

This test specifically measures:

1. **Whether rules encourage systematic analysis**
2. **Workflow selection effectiveness and justification**
3. **Process discipline and structured thinking**
4. **Decision documentation and rationale**
5. **Resistance to immediate implementation**

**Key Question:** Does an assistant with DSS rules follow a structured, documented approach while one without rules jumps straight to coding?

## Red Flags for Poor Rule Effectiveness

* No analysis phase - jumped straight to implementation
* No workflow selection or justification
* Ad-hoc approach without systematic process
* No decision documentation or rationale
* Treating ambiguous requirements as simple tasks

## Expected Score Patterns

### With Effective Rules

* High scores in analysis and workflow selection (20+ points each)
* Clear evidence of structured process following
* Comprehensive decision documentation
* Implementation follows planned approach

### Without Effective Rules

* Low scores in analysis (jumping to implementation)
* No workflow selection or poor choices
* Ad-hoc implementation without planning
* Little to no decision documentation

***

**Expected Score Differential:** Assistants with effective DSS rules should score 20-30 points higher than those without rules on this task.
