# REALISTIC MARKING SCHEME: Improve User System (HIDDEN)

> **⚠️ DO NOT SHOW THIS TO THE ASSISTANT DURING TESTING**

## Framework Overview

This rubric measures **automatic DSS behaviors** rather than instruction compliance. The task provided deliberately ambiguous  
requirements, so we evaluate whether DSS rules enabled intelligent problem analysis and workflow selection automatically.

**Task Given:** "Users are complaining about authentication issues and want better profile management. Can you fix this and add the missing features?"

**Key Question:** Did DSS rules enable the assistant to analyze ambiguous requirements, select appropriate workflows, and make intelligent  
decisions about system improvements?

## Evaluation Examples

### Example: Excellent DSS Performance (Score: 91/100)

**What the assistant created automatically:**

```markdown
# analysis-user-system-improvements.md
---
tags: [analysis, user-system, requirements, workflow-decision]
provides: [system-analysis, improvement-plan]
requires: [user_model, authentication_module]
---

# User System Analysis & Improvement Plan

## Current State Investigation

After examining the existing files:
- `src/models/user.py`: Basic user model lacking profile fields
- `src/auth/authentication.py`: Authentication present but missing session management
- `docs/authentication.md`: Limited documentation

## Identified Issues

1. **Authentication Problems**: No session persistence, weak token management
2. **Profile Management Gaps**: No profile data storage, no user preferences

## Proposed Solutions

[Detailed technical plan with specific improvements...]
```

**Then implemented coordinated improvements across multiple files with proper integration.**

**Scoring:**

* **Automatic DSS Behaviors:** 37/40 (excellent analysis and workflow management)
* **Technical Quality:** 32/35 (comprehensive problem resolution)
* **Decision-Making:** 22/25 (intelligent ambiguity resolution)

### Example: Poor DSS Performance (Score: 33/100)

**What the assistant created:**

```python
# user_fix.py (in root directory)
def fix_user_stuff():
    # some random fixes
    pass

def add_profile():
    pass
```

**Scoring:**

* **Automatic DSS Behaviors:** 6/40 (no analysis or workflow structure)
* **Technical Quality:** 13/35 (minimal problem resolution)
* **Decision-Making:** 14/25 (poor ambiguity handling)

## Key Evaluation Principles

### Evidence-Based Assessment

**Look for concrete evidence of intelligent problem-solving:**

* Investigation of existing files to understand current state
* Systematic analysis translating user complaints to technical issues
* Structured workflow approach rather than ad-hoc implementation
* Professional decision-making with documented rationale
* Coordinated improvements rather than isolated fixes

### Multiple Valid Approaches

**Accept various solutions that demonstrate DSS principles:**

* Different analysis structures (as long as systematic)
* Various improvement priorities (as long as well-reasoned)
* Different technical solutions (as long as address real issues)
* Various workflow selections (as long as appropriate for complexity)

### Process Over Outcome Focus

**Good process indicators for ambiguous requirements:**

* Evidence of studying existing system before making changes
* Structured approach to problem analysis and solution planning
* Professional assumption-making with clear rationale
* Maintenance of project integrity during improvements

## Deduction Guidelines

### Automatic Penalties (No warnings)

* **No investigation of existing system:** -8 points from Problem Analysis
* **Jumped to implementation without analysis:** -8 points from Workflow Selection
* **No interpretation of user complaints:** -8 points from Requirements Clarification
* **Random fixes without systematic approach:** -10 points from Problem Resolution
* **No documentation of decisions or assumptions:** -6 points from Ambiguity Resolution

### Bonus Considerations (up to +5 total)

* **Exceptional problem analysis and documentation:** +2 points
* **Outstanding systematic approach:** +2 points
* **Proactive consideration of user experience:** +2 points
* **Creative but appropriate solutions:** +1 point

## Validation Notes

This rubric measures whether DSS rules enabled intelligent handling of ambiguous requirements and systematic problem-solving. High scores  
indicate successful rule implementation for workflow decision-making; low scores suggest gaps in analysis and process management guidance.

**Key Success Indicator:** Solutions that demonstrate professional problem-solving approach, looking like they came from a senior  
developer who naturally knows how to analyze vague requirements and translate them into systematic technical improvements.
