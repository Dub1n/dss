# REALISTIC MARKING SCHEME: Add Notifications (HIDDEN)

> **⚠️ DO NOT SHOW THIS TO THE ASSISTANT DURING TESTING**

## Framework Overview

This rubric measures **automatic DSS behaviors** rather than instruction compliance. The task provided minimal guidance about adding  
notification functionality, so we evaluate whether DSS rules enabled professional integration with existing systems and automatic maintenance.

**Task Given:** "The app needs a notification system. Users should get email notifications for important events and see in-app  
notifications. They should also be able to manage their notification preferences."

**Key Question:** Did DSS rules enable the assistant to integrate notification functionality with automatic maintenance of project  
integrity and professional template usage?

### Example: Excellent DSS Performance (Score: 93/100)

**What the assistant created automatically:**

```python
# src/services/notifications.py
"""---
tags: [services, notifications, email, events]
provides: [notification_service, email_service, notification_events]
requires: [user_model, authentication_module, email_backend]
---"""

class NotificationService:
    def __init__(self):
        # Professional notification service with existing system integration

# src/models/notification.py
"""---
tags: [models, notifications, user-preferences]
provides: [notification_model, notification_preferences]
requires: [user_model, database]
---"""

# Extends existing User model patterns for notification preferences

# src/utils/email_sender.py

---"""

# Professional email utilities following project patterns

# docs/notifications.md
---
tags: [documentation, notifications, api, user-guide]
provides: [notification_documentation]
requires: [notification_service, user_model_documentation]
---

# Notification System

Integration with existing [User model](mdc:src/models/user.py) and [Authentication system](mdc:src/auth/authentication.py).
```

**Plus automatic updates to existing documentation with notification references.**

**Scoring:**

* **Automatic DSS Behaviors:** 37/40 (excellent maintenance and integration)
* **Technical Quality:** 33/35 (comprehensive notification system)
* **Decision-Making:** 23/25 (excellent integration strategy)

### Example: Poor DSS Performance (Score: 32/100)

**What the assistant created:**

```python
# notifications.py (in root directory)
def send_email(user, message):
    # basic email function
    pass

def show_notification(text):
    print(text)
```

**Scoring:**

* **Automatic DSS Behaviors:** 6/40 (no integration or maintenance)
* **Technical Quality:** 13/35 (minimal functionality, poor architecture)
* **Decision-Making:** 13/25 (poor understanding of requirements)

## Key Evaluation Principles

### Evidence-Based Assessment

**Look for concrete evidence of maintenance-focused development:**

* Integration with existing user and authentication systems
* Professional template usage and pattern recognition
* Cross-references and documentation updates across project
* Legacy code improvement and integration
* Coordinated file creation following project conventions

### Multiple Valid Approaches

**Accept various solutions that demonstrate DSS principles:**

* Different notification service architectures (as long as professional)
* Various email integration strategies (as long as secure)
* Different preference management approaches (as long as user-friendly)
* Various documentation structures (as long as comprehensive and cross-referenced)

### Process Over Outcome Focus

**Good process indicators for maintenance-heavy tasks:**

* Evidence of studying existing project structure before adding notifications
* Professional integration rather than isolated feature addition
* Automatic maintenance of project documentation and cross-references
* Enhancement of existing systems rather than replacement

## Deduction Guidelines

### Automatic Penalties (No warnings)

* **No integration with existing user/auth systems:** -12 points from Cross-System Integration
* **Notification system in isolation:** -10 points from Template Recognition
* **No documentation updates for new functionality:** -8 points from Maintenance Integration
* **Legacy code ignored or poorly handled:** -8 points from Legacy Code Integration
* **Single file approach to complex notification system:** -10 points from Architecture

### Bonus Considerations (up to +5 total)

* **Exceptional integration with existing systems:** +2 points
* **Outstanding maintenance of project integrity:** +2 points
* **Proactive security considerations for notifications:** +2 points
* **Creative but appropriate notification features:** +1 point

## Validation Notes

This rubric measures whether DSS rules enabled professional handling of maintenance-heavy integration tasks automatically. High scores  
indicate successful rule implementation for complex system integration; low scores suggest gaps in maintenance and integration guidance.

**Key Success Indicator:** Solutions that demonstrate sophisticated understanding of project-wide integration, looking like they came from  
a senior developer who naturally knows how to add complex functionality while maintaining project integrity and following established patterns.
