# REALISTIC MARKING SCHEME: User Profile Management (HIDDEN)

> **⚠️ DO NOT SHOW THIS TO THE ASSISTANT DURING TESTING**

## Framework Overview

This rubric measures **automatic DSS behaviors** rather than instruction compliance. The task provided minimal guidance, so we evaluate  
whether DSS rules enabled professional multi-file coordination and architectural decision-making automatically.

**Task Given:** "The Flask app needs user profile functionality. Users should be able to view and edit their profiles, upload profile  
pictures, and manage their settings."

**Key Question:** Did DSS rules enable the assistant to coordinate complex changes across multiple files with professional architectural decisions?

tags: [models, profile, user, data]
provides: [user_profile_model, profile_data_management]
requires: [user_model, database]
---"""

class UserProfile:

from flask import Blueprint, request, jsonify
from src.auth.authentication import login_required
from src.models.profile import UserProfile

profile_bp = Blueprint('profiles', __name__)

@profile_bp.route('/api/profiles/<int:user_id>', methods=['GET'])

* Different documentation structures (as long as comprehensive)

### Process Over Outcome Focus

**Good process indicators for complex tasks:**

* Evidence of studying existing multi-file structure

## Validation Notes

This rubric measures whether DSS rules enabled professional handling of complex, multi-file coordination tasks automatically. High scores  
indicate successful rule implementation for complex workflows; low scores suggest gaps in coordination and architectural guidance.

**Key Success Indicator:** Solutions that demonstrate sophisticated understanding of complex system integration, looking like they came  
from a senior developer who naturally knows how to coordinate changes across multiple files and systems.
