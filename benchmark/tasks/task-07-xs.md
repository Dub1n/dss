# Task 07: Improve User System

Users are complaining about authentication issues and want better profile management. Can you fix this and add the missing features?

## Current System
- Flask app with basic user authentication
- Existing files: `src/models/user.py`, `src/auth/authentication.py`
- Some documentation in `docs/authentication.md`

## Working Environment
Create workspace: `task_repos/task_07/`
