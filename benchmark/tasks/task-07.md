# Task 07: Ambiguous Requirements Resolution

You receive this **deliberately ambiguous** request from a project stakeholder:

> "We need to improve our user system. Users are complaining about authentication issues and want better profile management.  
> Can you fix this and add the missing features? Make sure everything works together properly."

## üéØ The Challenge

This task tests whether you can:

1. **Analyze ambiguous requirements** and ask clarifying questions OR make reasonable assumptions
2. **Select appropriate workflow** based on task complexity assessment
3. **Follow structured process** rather than jumping into implementation
4. **Document decision-making** process and rationale
5. **Apply DSS maintenance** principles automatically

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Your Task Repository

**First, create your isolated task environment:**

```powershell
# Create your task directory
mkdir task_repos/task_07
cd task_repos/task_07

# Copy all existing source files for analysis
mkdir -p src/models src/auth src/api
cp ../../task_repos/src/models/user.py src/models/
cp ../../task_repos/src/auth/authentication.py src/auth/

# Create the fixed API init file (without broken import)
@"
---
tags: [api, flask, endpoints, blueprints]
provides: [api_blueprint, api_routes]
requires: [flask]
---

"""API module for Flask application endpoints."""

from flask import Blueprint

# Main API blueprint
api_bp = Blueprint('api', __name__, url_prefix='/api')

# API endpoint configurations and routes will be defined in sub-modules
"@ | Out-File -FilePath src/api/__init__.py -Encoding UTF8

# Create docs with basic auth documentation
mkdir -p docs
@"
---
tags: [documentation, authentication, api]
provides: [auth_documentation, authentication_guide]
requires: [authentication_module]
---

# Authentication Documentation

Basic authentication system documentation for analysis.

## Current Features
- User authentication via authentication.py module
- Basic user management via user.py model

## Known Issues
- [To be identified through analysis]
"@ | Out-File -FilePath docs/authentication.md -Encoding UTF8

# Create complete project structure
mkdir -p src/utils tests
```

This gives you the complete existing codebase to analyze for problems and improvement opportunities.

## üìã Current Project Context

**Existing Codebase:**

* `src/models/user.py` - Basic user model (possibly has issues?)
* `src/auth/authentication.py` - Authentication module (possibly has problems?)
* `docs/authentication.md` - Auth documentation
* Various other files in standard DSS structure

**Unknown Factors:**

* What specific authentication issues exist?
* What profile management features are missing?
* How do these systems currently interact?
* What does "works together properly" mean?

## üîç What You Must Do

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis (Required)

Before writing any code, you must:

1. **Analyze the existing codebase** to understand current state
2. **Identify specific problems** or gaps in functionality
3. **Document your findings** and assumptions
4. **Propose a solution approach** with rationale

### Phase 2: Workflow Selection (Required)

Based on your analysis:

1. **Determine task complexity** (simple fix vs. complex integration)
2. **Select appropriate workflow** (quick task, code modification, task decomposition, etc.)
3. **Justify your workflow choice** with specific reasoning
4. **Outline your planned process** step by step

### Phase 3: Implementation (Optional)

If time permits and approach is clear:

* Implement your proposed solution
* Follow the workflow you selected
* Maintain DSS standards throughout

## üß™ Success Criteria

### Requirements Analysis (40%)

* [ ] **Codebase examination:** Analyzed existing files to understand current state
* [ ] **Problem identification:** Specific issues or gaps identified
* [ ] **Assumption documentation:** Clear assumptions about requirements
* [ ] **Solution proposal:** Reasonable approach to addressing issues

### Workflow Selection (40%)

* [ ] **Complexity assessment:** Accurate evaluation of task scope
* [ ] **Workflow choice:** Appropriate workflow selected for the situation
* [ ] **Process planning:** Clear step-by-step plan following chosen workflow
* [ ] **Rationale documentation:** Reasoning for decisions provided

### Process Following (20%)

* [ ] **Structured approach:** Followed systematic process rather than ad-hoc implementation
* [ ] **DSS maintenance:** Considered cross-references, documentation updates, etc.
* [ ] **Decision documentation:** Recorded key decisions and trade-offs

## üéØ What This Tests

This task specifically tests whether DSS rules help with:

### 1. **Ambiguity Resolution**

* Do you analyze before implementing?
* Do you document assumptions and decisions?
* Do you follow structured problem-solving?

### 2. **Workflow Selection Effectiveness**

* Do you assess task complexity accurately?
* Do you choose appropriate workflows?
* Do you follow workflow steps systematically?

### 3. **Rule-Guided Decision Making**

* Do you leverage DSS guidelines for decisions?
* Do you consider maintenance implications?
* Do you follow template-first approaches?

### 4. **Process Discipline**

* Do you resist jumping straight to code?
* Do you document your reasoning?
* Do you follow systematic approaches?

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls (What NOT to Do)

‚ùå **Jumping straight to implementation** without analysis
‚ùå **Making random assumptions** without documentation
‚ùå **Treating as simple single-file task** without assessment
‚ùå **Ignoring workflow selection** and using ad-hoc approach
‚ùå **Not documenting decisions** or rationale

## üìã Deliverables

At minimum, you must provide:

1. **Analysis Document** (`analysis-user-system-improvements.md`)
   * Current state assessment
   * Identified problems/gaps
   * Documented assumptions
   * Proposed solution approach

2. **Workflow Decision Document**
   * Complexity assessment
   * Chosen workflow with justification
   * Planned process steps
   * Rationale for approach

3. **Implementation** (if time permits)
   * Code changes following chosen workflow
   * DSS-compliant structure and maintenance

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time Management

**Recommended allocation:**

* **Analysis (5-7 minutes):** Understanding current state and problems
* **Planning (3-5 minutes):** Workflow selection and process planning
* **Implementation (5-7 minutes):** Following chosen workflow (if time permits)

## üìö Available Resources

* Existing codebase files for analysis
* DSS workflow documentation (if configured)
* Template patterns and conventions
* Cross-reference and maintenance guidelines

**The key test:** Does an assistant with good DSS rules follow a structured, documented decision-making process,  
while one without rules jumps straight to random implementation?
