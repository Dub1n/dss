# Task 02: User Module Documentation

The User module in `src/models/user.py` needs documentation so other developers can understand how to use it.

## Current System
- Flask web app with existing User model at `src/models/user.py`
- Basic docs structure with `docs/` directory
- Authentication system may be added later

## Working Environment
Create workspace: `task_repos/task_02/`
