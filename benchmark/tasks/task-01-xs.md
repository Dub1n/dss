The Flask web application needs user authentication functionality. Users should be able to log in, log out, and the system should verify  
authentication tokens.

## Current System

- Flask web app with existing user model at `src/models/user.py`
- Standard project structure with `src/`, `docs/`, `tests/` directories

## Working Environment

Create workspace: `task_repos/task_01/`
