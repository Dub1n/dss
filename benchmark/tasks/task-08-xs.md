# Task 08: Add Notifications

The app needs a notification system. Users should get email notifications for important events and see in-app notifications. They should also be able to manage their notification preferences.

## Current System
- Flask web app with existing user system
- Files: `src/models/user.py`, `src/auth/authentication.py`
- Documentation in `docs/` directory
- Some legacy notification code that needs integration

## Working Environment
Create workspace: `task_repos/task_08/`
