# DSS Benchmark: Realistic Task Evaluation

*Testing whether DSS rules enable automatic, professional behavior in response to minimal, realistic user requests.*

## 🎯 Core Purpose

**Key Question:** Do DSS rules make assistants naturally behave like senior developers who automatically apply best practices, or do they  
require explicit instruction for every desired behavior?

**Testing Approach:** Give assistants minimal, realistic tasks (just user intent) and measure whether professional behaviors emerge  
automatically through DSS rules.

**Why This Matters:** If assistants need explicit instructions to follow DSS conventions, the rules have failed. The goal is invisible,  
automatic professionalism.

## 🔬 Testing Philosophy

### What We Test

**Automatic Behavior Emergence:** Evidence that DSS rules enable professional practices without explicit instruction:

- Frontmatter appears without frontmatter instructions
- Files are organized logically without placement guidance  
- Documentation is created automatically with cross-references
- Templates are used without template reminders
- Project maintenance happens automatically

### What We Don't Test

**Instruction Following:** Whether assistants can complete detailed checklists (this proves nothing about rule effectiveness)

### Realistic Task Design

Tasks contain only:

- **Business requirements:** What functionality is needed
- **System context:** Existing codebase and constraints
- **Success criteria:** Observable outcomes

Tasks specifically exclude:

- DSS process instructions
- Template usage reminders
- Frontmatter requirements
- File placement guidance
- Maintenance task lists

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup Your Rules

```bash
# Copy your DSS rules to test
cp -r /path/to/your/rules/* .cursor/rules/

# Open this repository in Cursor
```

### 2. Run Realistic Benchmark

Give your assistant a minimal command like a real user would:

> Complete benchmark task 01-xs following RUN_BENCHMARK.md

**The assistant will:**

- Read a minimal, realistic task (just user intent)
- Complete the task using only DSS rule guidance
- Evaluate their work against automatic behavior criteria
- Score based on evidence of rule-guided professionalism
- Record results measuring DSS rule effectiveness

### 3. Compare Against Baseline

```bash
# Test with minimal rules (control group)
python scripts/run_benchmark.py start baseline task-01-xs

# Test with full DSS rules  
python scripts/run_benchmark.py start dss-enhanced task-01-xs

# Compare automatic behavior emergence
python scripts/run_benchmark.py compare results_baseline.json results_dss.json
```

## 📊 Realistic Benchmark Tasks

### Task 01-XS: Authentication Module

```markdown
# Task: Authentication Module
The Flask web application needs user authentication functionality.
Users should be able to log in, log out, and verify tokens.

## Current System
- Flask web app with existing user model at src/models/user.py
- Standard project structure with src/, docs/, tests/ directories
```

**That's it.** No instructions about frontmatter, file placement, or DSS conventions.

### Task 06-XS: User Profile Management

```markdown
# Task: User Profile Management
The application needs comprehensive user profile functionality.
Users should be able to view/edit profiles with bio, avatar, and preferences.

## Current System
- User authentication: src/auth/authentication.py
- User model: src/models/user.py
- API structure: src/api/
```

### Task 08-XS: Notification System Integration

```markdown
# Task: Notification System Integration
A legacy notification system needs integration into the project.
Users need email notifications and in-app alerts with preferences.

## Legacy Code
[Provides actual legacy code files to integrate]
```

## 🎯 Automatic Behavior Evaluation

### Scoring Framework (100 points)

#### 1. Automatic DSS Behaviors (40 points)

**Evidence that DSS rules enabled professional practices automatically:**

- **File Organization (10pts):** Logical placement without placement instructions
- **Metadata & Documentation (10pts):** Frontmatter and docs created automatically  
- **Pattern Recognition (10pts):** Studied existing code patterns and applied consistently
- **Maintenance Integration (10pts):** Updated cross-references and dependencies automatically

#### 2. Technical Solution Quality (35 points)

**Professional merit of the implementation:**

- **Architecture & Design (15pts):** Sound technical decisions and patterns
- **Implementation Quality (10pts):** Clean, secure, robust code
- **Integration & Compatibility (10pts):** Works seamlessly with existing systems

#### 3. Decision-Making Quality (25 points)

**Intelligence of automatic choices made:**

- **Requirements Interpretation (10pts):** Thoughtful understanding of user needs
- **Technical Choices (10pts):** Appropriate tools and approaches selected
- **Scope & Completeness (5pts):** Balanced feature set, not over/under-engineered

### Evidence-Based Assessment

**High Score Indicators:**

- Frontmatter appears without being requested
- Files organized following project patterns automatically
- Documentation includes cross-references to existing files
- Code integrates naturally with existing systems
- Professional practices emerge without explicit instruction

**Low Score Indicators:**

- Generic implementations ignoring project context
- No metadata or documentation created
- Random file placement with no organization logic
- Code doesn't integrate with existing systems
- No evidence of studying project patterns

## 📈 Expected Performance Patterns

### Strong DSS Rules (80+ points)

- **Consistent automatic behaviors:** Files organized, documentation created, patterns followed
- **Professional integration:** Seamless work with existing systems
- **Context awareness:** Evidence of studying and applying project conventions
- **Maintenance integration:** Cross-references and dependencies handled automatically

### Weak/No DSS Rules (40-70 points)

- **Ad-hoc implementation:** No systematic approach or pattern recognition
- **Missing documentation:** No automatic documentation or metadata creation
- **Poor integration:** Generic code that ignores existing project structure
- **Isolated changes:** No consideration of project-wide impact or maintenance

### Baseline Comparison Critical

Test the same realistic tasks with minimal rules to establish what baseline behavior produces, then measure the DSS improvement delta.

## 🔒 Security Features

### Hidden Evaluation Criteria

- Realistic evaluation rubrics are hidden during task completion
- `.cursorignore` automatically manages rubric visibility
- Assistants cannot see scoring criteria while working
- Fair comparison between different rule configurations

### Unbiased Testing Environment

- Tasks contain no hints about desired behaviors
- Evaluation measures emergent behavior, not instruction following
- Multiple valid approaches accepted if they demonstrate DSS principles
- Focus on automatic professionalism rather than checklist compliance

## 📊 Rule Effectiveness Validation

### DSS Success Indicators

**Evidence that rules are working:**

- High scores on automatic behavior categories
- Consistent professional practices across different tasks
- Clear evidence of pattern recognition and project integration
- Maintenance behaviors happening without explicit requests

**Evidence that rules need improvement:**

- Low automatic behavior scores despite functional implementations
- No evidence of template or pattern usage
- Generic solutions that ignore project context
- Manual prompting needed for basic professional practices

### Control Group Analysis

**Critical for validation:** Test realistic tasks with both minimal rules and full DSS rules:

- **Baseline Group:** Minimal rules, measure natural assistant behavior
- **DSS Group:** Full DSS rules, measure improvement in automatic behaviors  
- **Effectiveness Delta:** Difference shows true DSS rule value

## 🎯 Success Criteria

### Effective DSS Rules Should Produce

- **15-35 point performance gaps** between rule variants on complex tasks
- **Consistent evidence** of automatic professional behaviors
- **Pattern recognition** and project integration without instruction
- **Professional maintenance** habits emerging naturally

### Red Flags (Rules Not Working)

- **Similar scores** regardless of rule quality (tasks too simple or rules ineffective)
- **No automatic behaviors** evident in high-scoring solutions
- **Generic implementations** that ignore project context
- **Manual prompting needed** for basic DSS practices

### The Ultimate Test

**High-scoring solutions should look like they came from a senior developer who naturally knows best practices, not a junior developer  
following explicit instructions.**

## 🔄 Workflow Example

### Realistic User Interaction

```text
User: "Add authentication to this Flask app"
Assistant: [Studies existing code patterns, creates src/auth/authentication.py 
          with proper frontmatter, integrates with existing user model, 
          creates documentation with cross-references, all automatically]
```

### What We Measure

- Did frontmatter appear without being requested?
- Were files organized following project patterns?
- Was documentation created with proper cross-references?
- Did the solution integrate naturally with existing systems?
- Is there evidence of studying existing code before implementing?

### What We Don't Measure

- Did they follow a checklist? (proves nothing about rule effectiveness)
- Did they implement specific function signatures? (too prescriptive)
- Did they create files where we told them to? (instruction following, not rule guidance)

## 📝 Key Insights

### Why Realistic Tasks Matter

**Problem with instruction-heavy tasks:** Can't distinguish between rule-guided behavior and instruction-following.

**Solution with minimal tasks:** Only DSS rules can guide professional behavior when explicit instructions are absent.

### Why Automatic Behavior Measurement Matters

**Traditional evaluation:** "Did you add frontmatter?" (explicit instruction compliance)

**Realistic evaluation:** "Did frontmatter appear automatically?" (rule-guided behavior)

### The Real Goal

DSS rules should make assistants naturally exhibit professional development practices when given minimal, realistic requests - just like  
working with a senior developer who knows what to do without detailed instructions.

---

**Bottom Line:** If we have to tell an assistant to follow DSS conventions in the task description, our DSS rules have failed. The entire  
point is automatic, invisible professionalism.
