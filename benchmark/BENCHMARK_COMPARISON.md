# DSS Benchmark Comparison

*Automated comparison of different rule variants and their benchmark performance.*

## Overview

This table compares the performance of different DSS rule variants across benchmark tasks. Each entry represents an archived rule set with  
its associated benchmark results.

**Key:**

- **Average Score:** Overall performance across all tested tasks
- **Rules Location:** Link to archived rule files
- **Detailed Results:** Links to individual task scores and reports

**Interpretation:**

- Scores reflect evidence of automatic DSS behavior emergence, not just functional completion
- Higher scores indicate better rule-guided professional practices without explicit instruction
- Compare "Key Differences" sections to understand what rule changes impact performance

## Performance Comparison Table

|  Rules Version  |  task-01  |  task-06  |  task-07  |  task-08  |  Average  |
| --------------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- | --------- |
|  31_05_25       |  100      |  98       |  100      |  100      |  99.5     |
|  v1_02-06-25    |  86       |  98       |  100      |  100      |  96.0     |

## v1_02-06-25 (dss-enhanced)

**Date:** 2025-06-02  
**Average Score:** 96.0/100 (4 tasks)  
**Rules Location:** [rules_store/v1_02-06-25/](mdc:rules_store/v1_02-06-25/)

### Key Differences

*[To be filled manually - describe what's different in this version]*

### Benchmarking Notes  

**task-1:** Completed Task 01 (Create Authentication Module) with strong technical implementation but notable gaps in DSS-specific integration patterns. While code quality and documentation were excellent, adherence to DSS conventions showed room for improvement.
**task-6:** Exceptional performance on complex multi-file coordination task, demonstrating strong DSS rule utilization. Successfully implemented complete user profile management system across 7 files with coordinated architecture, comprehensive documentation, and maintenance integration. Minor syntax deduction for Python frontmatter format.
**task-7:** Exceptional performance demonstrating perfect utilization of DSS rules for ambiguous requirements resolution. Achieved maximum score across all categories through systematic analysis-first approach, appropriate workflow selection, and disciplined process following. Strong evidence that DSS rules enable structured problem-solving instead of ad-hoc implementation.
**task-8:** Perfect score achieved on the most maintenance-heavy benchmark task. Demonstrated exceptional DSS rule effectiveness with complete template utilization, comprehensive maintenance automation, and seamless legacy code integration. This represents the ideal outcome for DSS-enhanced development workflows.

## 31_05_25 (dss-enhanced)

**Date:** 2025-05-31  
**Average Score:** 99.5/100 (4 tasks)  
**Rules Location:** [rules_store/31_05_25/](mdc:rules_store/31_05_25/)

### Key Differences

Baseline DSS enhanced rules with comprehensive workflow system, template-first approach, and maintenance automation. Includes all 8  
workflows and 11 guidelines with Riley personality framework.

### Benchmarking Notes

Exceptional performance across complex tasks. Strong evidence of automatic professional behavior emergence. Template usage and maintenance  
integration working effectively. Minor syntax issues in Python frontmatter format (2 points lost in task-06).

**Detailed Results:**

- [task-06](mdc:rules_store/31_05_25/task_06_scores.json): 98/100
- [task-07](mdc:rules_store/31_05_25/task_07_scores.json): 100/100
- [task-08](mdc:rules_store/31_05_25/task_08_scores.json): 100/100
- [task-01](mdc:rules_store/31_05_25/task_1_scores.json): 100/100
