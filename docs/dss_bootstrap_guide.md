## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Backup First**: Always commit or backup your repository before transformation
2. **Internet Required**: Bootstrap downloads files from GitHub
3. **Python 3.8+**: Required for running the bootstrap script
4. **Cursor IDE**: Voice commands work best with Cursor editor
5. **Preservation**: Original repository is never modified (unless using `--in-place`)

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Bootstrap Fails to Download
```bash
# Check internet connection and GitHub access
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dub1n/dss/main/meta/scripts/dss_bootstrap.py
```

### Process Issues

#### Process Appears Stalled
- The bootstrap includes intelligent timeout management
- If no progress for 45 seconds, the process will automatically terminate
- Check the detailed progress output for stuck operations

#### Backup Creation Fails
```bash
# Bootstrap creates automatic backups
# If backup fails, transformation continues with warning
# Check disk space and permissions in parent directory
```

#### Unicode/Character Encoding Issues
- Bootstrap includes cross-platform Unicode handling
- If you see garbled characters, the system will automatically fall back to ASCII
- This is handled gracefully without stopping the transformation

#### File Organization Problems
- Bootstrap includes post-processing file organization
- If files have hash-like names, the system attempts automatic restoration
- Check the validation report for file organization issues

### General Issues

#### Voice Commands Not Working
1. Ensure `.cursor/rules/` directory was created
2. Restart Cursor after transformation
3. Try text commands first, then voice commands
4. Bootstrap creates project-specific rules in `enhanced_assistant.mdc`

#### Project Type Detection Issues
```bash
# Bootstrap provides detailed project analysis
python dss_bootstrap.py --dry-run
# Check the detected project type and technologies in the output
```

#### Transformation Validation Fails
- Bootstrap provides detailed validation reporting
- Check the validation results section in the output
- Each check shows ✅ (pass) or ❌ (fail) with specific details

## 🌟 Success Story

> *"I used the DSS bootstrap on my Android WearOS project and was amazed - it not only organized everything perfectly but actually detected it was a WearOS project and created specialized Cursor rules for small-screen development patterns. The automatic backup gave me confidence, and the detailed validation report showed exactly what was improved!"*
